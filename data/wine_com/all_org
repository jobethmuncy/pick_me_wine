It offers a lean to medium-weight mouthfeel with radiant fruit flavors—think pure cherry fruit. Fruit is harvested from a five-hectare parcel at 300 meters above sea level with calcareous sand and Galestro soils.

The Argiano 2015 Brunello di Montalcino shows a very lively bouquet that is already singing despite the young age of this new release. The wine opens to a dark ruby color with garnet highlights. The bouquet shows a large span of wild berry, earth, licorice spice and medicinal herb aromas. This vintage also reveals a pretty floral character with dried rose potpourri and lavender buds. After fermentation, the wine is aged slowly for 30 months in large oak botte (including 10-, 30- and 50-hectoliter capacity), thus restricting oxygen and gently slowing its evolution. However, the 2015 vintage is naturally expressive and exuberant, and that's the main takeaway here.

Blend: 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese, 7% Cabernet Franc","[<div class=""pipProfessionalReviews_review""><div class=""pipSecContent_copy"">I fussed over scoring this wine more than I'd like to admit—tasting through three samples under different conditions at various intervals and testing my impressions blind against wines in its peer group. Most importantly, I tasted this 2016 vintage against the 2015 vintage over and over again. I confess to a few nights of restless sleep as a result. Ultimately, my decision to award 100 points to the 2016 Solaia came on impulse and with the most natural sense of purpose. I had also given the 2015 vintage a perfect score, and intellectually, it seemed impossible not to pick a favorite among these two stunning expressions. I will also state, outright, that the wines are very different, principally because the 2015 vintage shows more overall opulence and sweetness that extends to the pronounced textural richness of the mouthfeel. The 2016 vintage, on the other hand, is more chiseled and sharp with mineral shadings of campfire ash and graphite at the rim of its dark fruit. The mouthfeel is more streamlined and tight at its core, suggesting that the wine will unfold and soften beautifully with time. I feel like 2015 is the Dolce &amp; Gabbana of the situation and the 2016 is the Armani Privé. The personalities of the two wines are distinct, yet my admiration for each is identical.</div></div>, <div class=""pipProfessionalReviews_review""><div class=""pipSecContent_copy"">Speechless here.

The 2016 somehow manages to be incredibly deep and also light on its feet. Sweet floral and spice notes add the closing shades of nuance to an exotic, beguilingly beautiful Solaia endowed with an eternal finish and mind-blowing beauty. The 2016 is an epic Solaia.

The tannins feel refined and silky, and the wine emanates a brightness and energy that propels the flavors outward, creating a three-dimensional impression.

Altero (which means “self-confident” in Italian) was born in 1983 as a ""simple"" I.G.T. that was (and remains today) identical to Brunello, and conforming to all the requirements for Brunello EXCEPT the mandatory aging period in wood (at that time three and a half years). This aging process certainly contributes to Altero’s forward nose and enveloping mouth-feel. Starting with the 1995 vintage, the aging period in wood required for Brunello was reduced to two years. Because from the very first vintage Altero had always conformed to these new requirements (and all the others), it automatically gained the status of Brunello di Montalcino. For these reasons Altero is referred to as the estate’s more ""modern"" Brunello.

Give this wine ample time to open and put on weight and volume. Or better yet, just stick the bottle in your cellar for a few more years. Fruit comes from a 1.6-hectare parcel at 420 meters above sea level. This site, located just below the Madonna delle Grazie chapel, has sandy mineral-rich soils. This wine is very different from the Alessandro Mori's classic Brunello. Here, you get that beautiful purity in the bouquet, but you also get a different mouthfeel that is characterized by more structure and a firmer set of tannins. However, the overall integration is superior here considering that this wine is richer and has more material and overall density. Cherry, grenadine and cassis are followed by jasmine and even a touch of exotic fruit. As the wine opens, you catch a hint of mesquite or hickory smoke. Some 7,040 bottles were made.

Much more brooding at the moment, this eventually opens with incense, black cherry and exotic spice. The palate is centred around a firm backbone which effortlessly supports a core of pristine fruit.

This is one of those wines. Indeed, previous editions of Cerretalto have earned the coveted 100 point score, and I am astutely aware of the pedigree and potential that comes forth with each new vintage. As enthusiastic as my assessment of the 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Cerretalto is, I'm stopping short of that perfect score. This vintage is something of a moving target with wines that are beautiful, without a doubt, yet the growing conditions were not even across the appellation, and achieving optimal tannic management posed a challenge to many producers. If I were to make any criticism of this wine, it would fall along those lines. That aside, this is a beautiful Brunello that boasts deep intensity and bold black fruit flavors that are plummy and rich. Spice, toasted oak and tobacco frame that primary fruit. Cerretalto ages in oak for 30 months and that strong imprint has added to the structure, depth and contemporary character of this A-list Brunello. That oak imprint is also reinforced in the wine's tannins. There's no doubt that this wine needs more cellar aging. I would absolutely not suggest drinking it within the next five years. Any awkwardness it shows now should iron itself out with more bottle time.</div></div>, <div class=""pipProfessionalReviews_review""><div class=""pipSecContent_copy""><p><span style=""color: rgb(66, 64, 64);"">There’s a lot in this wine, in terms of complexity, that is all underpinned by concentrated, ripe and assertive red cherries.

In 2013 the grapes were harvested during the second week of October, and though not designated as a Riserva, it's aged like one. 
<p>
It's a wine that takes time to come around, and the 2013 is characteristically closed, rigid and austere in its youth. It hints at dusty black cherry and wild plums wrapped up in a graphite and iron fist. Bracing acidity cuts through the intense, concentrated core. The oak is polished but needs to integrate, while stiff, sticky tannins demand a few years to soften.

The 2017 Giusto di Notri is a special 25th anniversary bottling that is chiseled, sharp and focused. The small part of Merlot gives it some added sweetness (the percentage of Merlot was slightly reduced in this vintage), the touch of Cabernet Franc contributes the power, freshness and dark fruit, and along with a starring role of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine has lots of beautiful plushness restrained by a tight, disciplined linearity. This vintage saw less time in barrique (about 16 months) but the barrels had more toasting. There is a lasting mineral note of chalk or limestone that frames the dark and opulence quality of fruit at its core. The bouquet is stunning.

Vineyards in Gaiole and Greve form the core of the blend, with a touch of fruit from Radda. The 2016 has enough freshness to drink well for another decade plus, but I would give it a few years in bottle for the bright acids to integrate a bit further. There are a number of pricier wines in Querciabella's range, but I am not sure any of them can match the Chianti Classico for pure pleasure. What a lovely wine it is.

If you consider this wine, his observation makes perfect sense. This warm vintage is powerful and rich in its natural state, so any additional berry density might easily lead to overextraction and heaviness. However, the mouthfeel is objectively thinner and more compact in this vintage. Colore represents a blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Colorino in equal parts. The bouquet is redolent of wild berry, dried cherry and toasted spice. This vintage offers a very attractive mineral note as well.

The 2017 Saffredi does not seem like a 2017 at all. Now celebrating its 30th birthday, Saffredi is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. Thanks to the vineyard's proximity to the sea, leaving leaves on the vines and the sharp diurnal shifts of the area, the fruit was able to ripen in a balanced manner despite the hot and dry summer. The team at Fattoria le Pupille knew they would have to be ready to harvest early and lose some their yields, and they did. In the end, production was down 25%, but the result is a fresh, thick and beautiful red made with ripe fruit and dark concentration. This is a great effort from Fattoria le Pupille.

An intriguing mineral character adds to the bouquet. Full and mouth-coating on entry and throughout the mid-palate, the wine shows layers of ripe, dark and juicy fruits, black cherry, plum and sweet blueberry. Licorice and dark chocolate notes further enhance the complexity. A hallmark of this wine in great vintages is the laser-perfect balance of acidity and tannin, giving freshness and incredible length to the finish. Well-integrated oak amplifies the structure without interfering with its elegance and drinkability. Barbaresco is a great food wine. Traditionally served with roasted braised meat such as beef, pork and boar, Barbaresco is actually very versatile: owing to its high acidity and red fruit profile. It pairs well with roasted chicken, veal, game birds and even seafood. Heartier pasta and risotto dishes are other obvious pairings, as are aged Italian cheeses.","[<div class=""pipProfessionalReviews_review""><div class=""pipSecContent_copy"">Aromas of rose, red

Although I can't claim any extraordinary differences between the two sessions, I noticed a few minimal shifts that are essential to understanding the wine's future aging ability. The 2016 Barbaresco starts off slow at first, showing a small margin of aromatic evolution in the glass. But come back two hours later, and you can almost hear the soft sounds of the symphony playing just below the surface. The 2016 vintage is characterized by the solid intensity and firmness of its aromas, which transcend fruit and veer toward balsamic herb, licorice, tar and smoke instead. The tannins offer a moment of sweetness and softness, before you are aware of their undeniable firmness. In all, there is a certain glossiness or satiny quality to the mouthfeel that underlines the wine's carefully crafted integration.

The warm midsummer gave rise to a depth of fruit that is expansive and generous but not cloying. The initial ripe fruit is supported by layers of spice, tar and mineral motes that give the wine structure and length. Though young, this is a relatively approachable Barolo which will improve in the bottle over the next decade. 
This wine finds its best matches at the table, with first courses of prosciutto, salami, Alba beef tartare and vitello tonnato. The wine is best with second courses of red meat in general, but also grilled fish or white meats, or with hard and aged cheeses.

Gaja Sori San Lorenzo 2014,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",489,750,"This wine made history when it became one of the earliest single-vineyard bottlings of Nebbiolo in Piedmont with the 1967 vintage. Sourced from the GAJA winery’s top growing site, San Lorenzo, located just south of the village of Barbaresco in the famed cru Secondine, the wine is made with 100% Nebbiolo grapes.
Deep red color, the 2014 Sori San Lorenzo shows aromas of licorice, black tea, savory and balsamic herbs notes, graphite and violet come out slowly in the glass giving birth to a complex and layered bouquet.

Like all the 2014s, it’s incredibly elegant on the palate, with a Burgundian-like texture, fine tannin, and terrific length.

Angelo Gaja and his family present spectacular results in this controversial 2014 vintage. They have risen far above most of their peers and have shown a keen ability to understand their site and the versatility of their cherished Nebbiolo grape.

Needs three to five years of bottle age on release. Unique red. Available in 2019.</div></div>, <div class=""pipProfessionalReviews_review""><div class=""pipSecContent_copy"">Packaged in its distinctive red label (red is for Riserva), the 2014 Barbaresco Riserva Asili represents a tremendous effort in a challenging but ultimately very rewarding vintage. This wine will be released in February 2019. The previous edition was 2011, and Bruna Giacosa tells me that it will be produced in 2016 and possibly 2017—although this has not yet been officially confirmed. In a normal vintage, production is 11,000 bottles strong, but because of reduced yields in 2014 we can expect some 8,000 bottles instead. Growing conditions in 2014 were cause for concern up until the end of August because of humidity and below average temperatures. Those conditions changed suddenly in the nick of time, bringing strong sunshine and warmth during the final stage of grape ripening. Ultimately, 2014 proved to be a long growing season with healthy fruit in reduced volume. The Rabajà cru sometimes shows a harder edge with more mineral definition.

Gaja Sperss 2014,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",289,750,"Sperss is a term affectionately used to denote nostalgia for precious things lost with time – a homage to the origins of the winery and the generations who built it. When the Gaja family decided to stop acquiring fruit from outside growers and bottle only estate-grown grapes, in 1961, it was a bold and difficult move. It would help to ensure a high standard of quality, but it also meant that for the first time in the winery’s history, they would not be able to produce a Barolo. In 1988, nearly three decades after that fateful decision was made, the GAJA winery purchased a 30-acre farm in Serralunga d’Alba and rechristened it Sperss.
Red garnet color, earthy and savory with pure notes of coal, tobacco, juniper, and sap. On the palate the wine is tense, loaded with energy that will need serious ageing to fully develop.

The vineyards in Serralunga d'Alba produced much less fruit than average and suffered from bouts of downy mildew during the rainy seasons. But Serralunga d'Alba fruit is also harvested late, and that extra time was important for achieving grape ripeness targets.

Those floral notes came forth with increased intensity and clarity in the bottle that had been opened longer. The bouquet continues to surprise with touches of black fruit and freshly milled white pepper. However, like many wines from Serralunga d’Alba, this expression from Lazzarito reveals a pretty inner paradox.
